# Project Brief

**Project Name:** Plant Assistant  
**Date Created:** 2025-08-11  
**Version:** 1.0  

## Project Summary
Plant Assistant is an AI-powered full-stack application designed to help urban dwellers and plant beginners successfully care for their plants. The application leverages artificial intelligence to solve common plant care challenges including identification, care guidance, health diagnosis, progress tracking, and conversational support.

## Core Problem Statement
Urban dwellers and plant beginners struggle with:
- Identifying unknown plants (from gifts, purchases, or wild finds)
- Providing optimal care (40% of plants die from overwatering)
- Early problem diagnosis (pests, diseases)
- Maintenance tracking and remembering care routines
- Accessing reliable, personalized plant care advice

This leads to frustration, financial waste, and discouragement from plant ownership.

## Primary Goals
**Short-Term (3 months):**
- Launch MVP with core features
- Acquire 1,000 active users through beta testing
- Achieve user validation and feedback loops
- Complete core feature set with 80%+ test coverage

**Long-Term (2 years):**
- Reach 100,000 users with 90% satisfaction (NPS scores)
- Generate $50K annual revenue through freemium model
- Integrate with plant retailers and IoT devices
- Expand to mobile apps (iOS/Android)

## Success Metrics
- Reduce plant death rates by 25% for users
- Achieve 99% uptime with <10K daily queries
- Maintain 4.5+ app store rating
- 70% of generated care plans saved by users
- 85%+ user satisfaction via NPS scores

## Target Audience
**Primary:** Urban homeowners/renters aged 25-45
- Tech-savvy millennials starting plant hobbies
- Limited space and time for plant care
- Mobile-first users preferring apps over books

**Secondary:** Gardeners, educators, plant retailers
- Need advanced diagnostic tools
- Require shareable care plans and references

## Scope & Constraints
**In Scope:**
- Plant identification via photos
- Personalized care advice and reminders

- Conversational chat interface
- User authentication and data persistence

**Out of Scope (Post-MVP):**
- IoT device integration
- Social community features
- E-commerce partnerships
- Mobile native apps
- Advanced analytics dashboard

## Budget & Resources
- **Development Timeline:** 3-month MVP
- **Team:** Solo development initially
- **Technology Stack:** Modern, cost-effective choices
- **External APIs:** OpenAI ($50-100/month estimated)
- **Infrastructure:** Cloud hosting with auto-scaling

## Risk Assessment
**High Risk:**
- AI accuracy with edge cases or rare plants
- User adoption in competitive market
- API cost scaling with user growth

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Comprehensive plant database with validation
- Clear disclaimers and fallback support
- Usage quotas and cost monitoring
- Feedback loops for continuous improvement

## Definition of Success
The project succeeds when users can confidently care for their plants with 25% fewer deaths, demonstrating improved plant ownership satisfaction and long-term engagement with the platform.
