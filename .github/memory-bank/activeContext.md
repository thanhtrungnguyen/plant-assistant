# Active Context

**Last Updated:** 2025-08-12  
**Current Focus:** Plant Diagnosis API Implementation  
**Status:** Core AI feature implemented, ready for testing

## Current Work Focus

### Immediate Priority
Implementing the core AI-powered plant diagnosis feature using LangGraph multi-agent system. This includes:

1. **‚úÖ Core API Implementation**: Built complete `/diagnose` endpoint with multi-agent workflow
2. **‚úÖ LangGraph Integration**: Implemented stateful workflow with 6 specialized agents
3. **‚úÖ OpenAI Integration**: Vision API for image analysis, GPT-4o for text generation
4. **üîÑ Testing & Validation**: Need real API key testing and integration tests
5. **‚è≥ Performance Optimization**: Monitor costs and response times

### Current Session Objectives
- ‚úÖ Implement complete plant diagnosis API with LangGraph multi-agent system
- ‚úÖ Add required dependencies (OpenAI, LangGraph, LangChain, Pillow)
- ‚úÖ Create comprehensive error handling and validation
- ‚úÖ Build FastAPI endpoint with file upload support
- ‚úÖ Add unit tests for API functionality
- ‚úÖ Verify API server startup and documentation
- üîÑ **IN PROGRESS**: Testing with real OpenAI API key
- ‚è≥ **NEXT**: Integration testing and performance optimization

## Recent Changes & Discoveries

### Project Understanding
From analyzing the existing codebase and documentation, I've identified:

**Current Implementation Status:**
- **Backend**: FastAPI application with user authentication system in place
- **Frontend**: Next.js application with shadcn/ui components and TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM and Alembic migrations
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suites for both frontend and backend
- **Development Environment**: Docker Compose setup with hot reload

**Existing Features:**
- User registration, authentication, and management (fastapi-users)
- Basic item/plant management API endpoints
- Auto-generated OpenAPI client for frontend
- Email system with MailHog for development
- Comprehensive development tooling (linting, formatting, type checking)

**Architecture Strengths:**
- Strong type safety across the full stack
- Clean separation of concerns with domain-driven structure
- Modern development practices with pre-commit hooks
- Comprehensive documentation and setup guides

### Key Insights
1. **Solid Foundation**: The project has excellent architectural foundations with modern best practices
2. **AI Integration Readiness**: Structure supports adding AI features without major refactoring
3. **Scalability Considerations**: Design patterns support future microservice extraction
4. **Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling and documentation for productive development

## Next Steps & Decisions

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Complete Memory Bank**: Finish creating all required memory bank files
2. **Task System Setup**: Initialize task management with current project status
3. **Progress Assessment**: Document what's built vs. what needs to be implemented
4. **Development Planning**: Identify next features to implement based on MVP requirements

### Active Decisions & Considerations

**AI Integration Strategy:**
- **Decision Pending**: Choose between OpenAI-only vs. multi-provider approach
- **Consideration**: Cost management and usage quotas for MVP launch
- **Timeline**: AI features are core to the value proposition, high priority

**Database Strategy:**
- **Current**: PostgreSQL for structured data
- **Future**: Adding Chroma vector database for AI embeddings
- **Decision**: Implement as separate service or integrate directly

**Feature Prioritization:**
- **High Priority**: Plant identification (core feature, user validation)
- **Medium Priority**: Care reminders and tracking (engagement driver)  
- **Lower Priority**: Advanced analytics and social features (post-MVP)

### Development Environment Notes
- **Setup Status**: Development environment is fully configured and functional
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suites in place, need to maintain coverage as features are added
- **Deployment**: Vercel deployment configuration ready for frontend, backend deployment strategy TBD

## Context for Future Sessions

### Memory Reset Preparation
When I return to this project after a memory reset, I will need to:
1. **Read ALL memory bank files** to understand project state and context
2. **Review task management system** for current priorities and progress
3. **Check active development** by examining recent commits and file changes
4. **Assess testing status** to understand what needs validation

### Key Patterns to Remember
- **FastAPI Best Practices**: Following established patterns from best-practices.instructions.md
- **Type Safety**: Maintaining end-to-end type safety as primary architectural principle
- **Domain Structure**: Keep domain boundaries clear for future scalability
- **User-Centric Design**: All features must solve real user problems identified in product research

### Critical Success Factors
1. **AI Feature Quality**: Core differentiator depends on AI accuracy and user experience
2. **Performance**: Sub-second response times critical for user engagement
3. **User Onboarding**: Smooth first-time experience essential for retention
4. **Mobile Experience**: Primary usage will be mobile, optimize for mobile-first

### Technical Debt & Maintenance
- **Code Quality**: Maintain high standards with automated tooling
- **Documentation**: Keep memory bank and code documentation current
- **Testing**: Maintain 80%+ test coverage as features are added
- **Security**: Regular security reviews, especially for AI integrations and user data

This active context will be updated after each significant development session to maintain continuity and focus.
