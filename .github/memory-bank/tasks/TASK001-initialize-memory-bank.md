# [TASK001] - Initialize Memory Bank System

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-08-11  
**Updated:** 2025-08-12

## Original Request
User requested "init the memory bank" to set up the comprehensive project documentation and context system for maintaining continuity across development sessions.

## Thought Process
The Memory Bank system is critical for this project since my memory resets completely between sessions. I analyzed the existing project structure and documentation to understand:

1. **Current State**: The project has a solid foundation with FastAPI backend, Next.js frontend, and comprehensive development tooling, but lacks the AI features that are core to its value proposition.

2. **Documentation Needs**: Required comprehensive documentation of project goals, architecture, technology choices, current progress, and future plans to enable effective continuation of work.

3. **Structure Decision**: Implemented the full memory bank structure as defined in the instructions, including all core files and the task management system.

4. **Content Strategy**: Focused on capturing both the technical implementation details and the business context that drives development decisions.

## Implementation Plan
- ✅ Create memory bank folder structure
- ✅ Write projectbrief.md with comprehensive project overview
- ✅ Document productContext.md with user needs and market analysis
- ✅ Capture systemPatterns.md with architectural decisions
- ✅ Document techContext.md with technology stack details
- ✅ Create activeContext.md for current work focus
- ✅ Write progress.md documenting what's complete vs. remaining
- ✅ Set up tasks folder with index and initial task files
- ⏳ Update .github/instructions if needed based on project patterns

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Complete - 100%
