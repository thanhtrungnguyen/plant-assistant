# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### Market Problem
The houseplant market has grown significantly (reaching $1.7B in US, with 70% of millennials owning plants), but plant ownership success rates remain low. Studies show that 30-40% of houseplants die within the first year due to improper care, leading to:

- **Economic waste**: Users repeatedly purchasing replacement plants
- **Environmental impact**: Unnecessary plant production and disposal
- **User frustration**: Discouragement from plant ownership and gardening
- **Knowledge gap**: Fragmented information sources with conflicting advice

### Market Opportunity
Current solutions are fragmented:
- **Plant ID apps** (PlantSnap, PlantNet): Focus only on identification
- **Care guides** (books, websites): Generic, not personalized
- **Garden centers**: Expensive consultations, limited availability
- **Online forums**: Inconsistent quality, delayed responses

**Gap**: No comprehensive AI-powered platform that provides personalized, ongoing plant care assistance from identification through long-term maintenance.

## Problems It Solves

- **"Something's wrong with my plant"** → Visual diagnosis and treatment recommendations
- **"I keep forgetting to water"** → Smart reminders and tracking systems
- **"I don't know if my plant is healthy"** → Progress tracking with AI insights

### For Experienced Users (Secondary)
- **"I need professional references"** → Science-backed recommendations with sources
- **"I want to track multiple plants"** → Comprehensive plant management system
- **"I need to share care instructions"** → Exportable care plans and histories

## How It Should Work
