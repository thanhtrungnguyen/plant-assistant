## Summary
The app solves plant care challenges by offering AI-assisted tools. Requirements are derived from user research (e.g., surveys showing 70% of beginners kill plants due to improper care). Prioritize MVP for quick validation, with hooks for future expansions like community forums or AR plant scanning.

## Rationale for Business Approach
- Alignment with Market Trends: Plant care apps are growing (e.g., $500M market by 2025 per reports), but few use AI comprehensively.
- Monetization Strategy: Start free to build user base, then upsell premiums for advanced features (e.g., unlimited AI queries).
- Compliance: Ensure GDPR for data handling from day one.
- Scaling Plan: Use modular design to add features without refactoring; e.g., microservices if user base exceeds 10K.
