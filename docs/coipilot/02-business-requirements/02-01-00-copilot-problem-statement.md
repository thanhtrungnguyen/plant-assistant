# Plant Assistant Problem Statement for GitHub Copilot

## Problem Statement
Urban dwellers and beginners often face difficulties in:
- Identifying unknown plants (e.g., from gifts or wild finds), leading to incorrect care.
- Providing optimal care, resulting in issues like overwatering (common cause of 40% plant deaths).
- Diagnosing problems early, such as pests or diseases, which can spread to other plants.
- Tracking maintenance, causing forgetfulness in routines like fertilizing.

This leads to frustration, waste, and discouragement from gardening. The app addresses this by centralizing AI-driven solutions, reducing reliance on fragmented online resources or experts.

## Detailed Impact
- Economic: Users spend $ on replacements; app could save by increasing plant longevity (e.g., 20% reduction in deaths).
- Environmental: Promotes sustainable practices (e.g., water conservation tips to reduce usage by 15%).
- User Pain Points: Based on hypothetical user interviews: "I buy plants but they die because I don't know their needs." Common scenarios: Busy professionals forgetting watering, or beginners misidentifying toxic plants.
- Market Gap: Competitors like PlantSnap focus on ID only; this app adds ongoing assistance with AI personalization.

## Scaling Considerations
- Future Problems: Handle rare plants or regional variations (e.g., integrate global databases like USDA API).
- Evolution: As users grow, add social features to share success stories, turning problems into community learning.
- Data-Driven: Collect anonymized usage data to identify emerging issues (e.g., climate change impacts on plants).
