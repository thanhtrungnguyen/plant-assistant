# Plant Assistant Best Practices Overview for GitHub Copilot

This file overviews best practices. For details, refer to sub-files:

- copilot-security.md
- copilot-testing.md

## Summary
Practices ensure code quality, security, and scalability. Based on standards like PEP8 for Python, Airbnb style for JS. Emphasize automation (linters in CI) for consistency.

## Overall Approach
- Separation of Concerns: Services for logic, routes for API.
- Documentation: Inline comments, API docs via FastAPI.
- Version Control: Git branches for features, semantic versioning.

## Scaling Considerations
- Adopt as project grows: e.g., add SonarQube for code quality scans.
