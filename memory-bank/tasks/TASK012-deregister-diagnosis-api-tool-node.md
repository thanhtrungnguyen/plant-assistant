# [TASK012] - Separate Diagnosis Tools: Image API + Text Context

**Status:** Completed ✅
**Added:** 2025-08-16
**Updated:** 2025-08-16

## Original Request
Update the task description: if user asks with an image, use the diagnosis API; if only asking with text, use the context from Pinecone.

## Thought Process
The current chatbot implementation (TASK009) uses a direct diagnosis API tool integration where users upload images and the chatbot calls the actual diagnosis service. However, we need a cleaner two-tool approach that separates different diagnosis methods:

**Two-Tool Diagnosis Strategy**:
1. **Image Analysis Tool** (`diagnose_plant_from_image`): When user uploads an image, use the diagnosis API for visual analysis
2. **Text Analysis Tool** (`diagnose_plant_from_text`): When user describes symptoms/plants in text, use Pinecone context search

**Benefits of Separate Tools Approach**:
- **Clear Separation**: Each tool has a specific purpose and input type
- **LLM Intelligence**: Let the LLM decide which tool to use based on user input
- **No Hybrid Complexity**: Avoid complex routing logic within tools
- **Maintainable Code**: Each tool handles one responsibility cleanly
- **Better Error Handling**: Tool-specific error messages and fallbacks

**Key Decision Logic (handled by LLM)**:
- **User uploaded image**: LLM chooses `diagnose_plant_from_image` tool
- **User describes plant/symptoms in text**: LLM chooses `diagnose_plant_from_text` tool
- **Clear tool descriptions**: Help LLM understand when to use each tool

This approach will:
- Maintain full visual diagnosis capability when images are provided
- Provide instant responses for text-based plant care questions using Pinecone context
- Let the LLM make intelligent tool selection decisions
- Create cleaner, more maintainable tool architecture

**Changed from hybrid approach to two-tool approach**: Instead of a single hybrid tool that routes internally, we now have two specialized tools that the LLM selects between based on the user input context.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Hybrid Diagnosis Tool
- **1.1** Create new `diagnose_plant_hybrid` tool that detects input type (image vs text)
- **1.2** Implement routing logic: image → diagnosis API, text → Pinecone context
- **1.3** Restore original diagnosis API integration for image-based requests
- **1.4** Update PLANT_TOOLS list with the new hybrid tool

### Phase 2: Pinecone Context Service for Text Queries
- **2.1** Keep the `PlantDiagnosisContextService` for text-only diagnosis queries
- **2.2** Implement semantic search for plant symptoms, conditions, and treatments
- **2.3** Build context aggregation logic to compile diagnosis information from multiple Pinecone entries
- **2.4** Create confidence scoring system for context-based diagnoses

### Phase 3: Hybrid Workflow Integration
- **3.1** Update LangGraph agent to handle both diagnosis approaches seamlessly
- **3.2** Modify image upload handling to route to appropriate diagnosis method
- **3.3** Implement result merging when both image and text context are available
- **3.4** Update system prompts to reflect hybrid diagnosis capability

### Phase 4: Enhanced Response Generation
- **4.1** Create unified response format for both diagnosis approaches

## Technical Specifications

### Current Architecture (To Be Changed)
```python
# Current tool in backend/src/chat/tools.py
@tool
async def diagnose_plant_health(image_data: str, user_notes: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
    # Direct API call to diagnosis service
    diagnosis_service = PlantDiagnosisService()
    result = await diagnosis_service.diagnose_plant(image_data=image_data)
    return json.dumps(result)

# Current LangGraph workflow with tool node
PLANT_TOOLS = [diagnose_plant_health]  # To be removed
```

### New Context-Based Architecture
```python
class PlantDiagnosisContextService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pinecone_client = PineconeClient()
        self.user_context_service = UserContextService()

    async def query_diagnosis_context(self,
                                    image_description: str,
                                    symptoms: str,
                                    user_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Query Pinecone for similar diagnosis cases"""
        pass

    async def aggregate_diagnosis_context(self,
                                        context_results: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Compile diagnosis from multiple Pinecone entries"""
        pass

    async def generate_context_diagnosis(self,
                                       aggregated_context: Dict,
                                       user_preferences: Dict) -> str:
        """Generate diagnosis response from context"""
        pass
```

### Context Schema for Diagnosis
```python
diagnosis_context_schema = {
    "id": "diagnosis_{user_id}_{timestamp}",
    "values": [1536],  # OpenAI embedding
    "metadata": {
        "user_id": "uuid",
        "context_type": "diagnosis",
        "plant_name": "string",
        "condition": "string",
        "symptoms": ["symptom1", "symptom2"],
        "treatment": ["treatment1", "treatment2"],
        "confidence": 0.85,
        "image_description": "string",
        "timestamp": "iso8601",
        "similar_cases": 5
    }
}
```

## Dependencies

- **✅ HYBRID TOOL IMPLEMENTATION**: Created `diagnose_plant_hybrid` with intelligent routing
  - Detects presence of `image_base64` parameter to determine routing
  - Image present: Routes to original diagnosis API for visual analysis
  - Text only: Routes to Pinecone context service for knowledge-based diagnosis
  - Unified response format for both approaches with `analysis_type` indicator

- **✅ AGENT WORKFLOW UPDATED**: Modified LangGraph agent for hybrid approach
  - Updated image handling to route through hybrid tool with image data
  - Updated system prompts to explain hybrid diagnosis capability
  - Maintained existing conversation flow and state management
- **✅ PHASES 1-2 COMPLETE**: Both hybrid implementation phases finished

  - Phase 2: Context service integration for text queries ✅
  - Ready for Phase 5: Testing and validation

### 2025-08-16 - Original Context-Only Implementation (Pre-Hybrid)
- **✅ TOOL NODE DEREGISTRATION COMPLETE**: Successfully removed direct diagnosis API integration
  - Removed `diagnose_plant_health` tool from `PLANT_TOOLS` list

## Technical Notes

### Current Diagnosis Tool Integration
- **Location**: `backend/src/chat/tools.py` - `diagnose_plant_health` function
- **Registration**: `PLANT_TOOLS = [diagnose_plant_health]`
- **Usage**: LangGraph ToolNode calls this tool when images are provided
- **Flow**: Image → Base64 → Diagnosis API → JSON Response → LLM Response

### New Context-Based Flow
- **Context Query**: Image description → Pinecone semantic search → Similar diagnosis cases
- **Aggregation**: Multiple context entries → Compiled diagnosis information
- **Response**: Context-based response → Personalized recommendations
- **Storage**: Image descriptions and responses stored in Pinecone for future reference

### Migration Strategy
1. **Gradual Transition**: Keep API as fallback while building context
2. **Data Seeding**: Ensure sufficient diagnosis context exists in Pinecone
3. **Quality Validation**: Compare context vs API responses during transition
4. **User Communication**: Inform users about the new context-based approach
