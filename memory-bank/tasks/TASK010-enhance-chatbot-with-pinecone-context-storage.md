# [TASK010] - Enhance Chatbot with Pinecone Context Storage

**Status:** Pending
**Added:** 2025-08-16
**Updated:** 2025-08-16

## Original Request
Create task10, now we enhance the bot by giving it a mechanism to store the context to pinecone via chat history, context store I think of will be user info and summary of the discussion

## Thought Process
The existing chatbot implementation (TASK009) provides basic conversational capabilities with database persistence. Now we need to enhance it with intelligent context management using Pinecone vector database for:

1. **User Context Storage**: Extract and store user information (preferences, plant collection details, care history) as embeddings
2. **Conversation Summarization**: Generate concise summaries of chat discussions and store them for future reference
3. **Semantic Context Retrieval**: Enable the bot to access relevant historical context when responding to user queries
4. **Personalized Responses**: Use stored context to provide more tailored and context-aware assistance

This enhancement will transform the chatbot from a stateless conversation tool into a context-aware assistant that learns and remembers user preferences, building stronger engagement over time.

Key technical considerations:
- **Pinecone Integration**: Set up vector database with proper indexing and metadata management
- **Embedding Generation**: Use OpenAI embeddings for semantic context representation
- **Context Extraction**: Implement intelligent parsing of chat history for user info and key discussion points
- **Retrieval Strategy**: Design efficient context lookup during conversation flow
- **Privacy & Data Management**: Ensure user context can be updated/deleted while maintaining conversation continuity

## Technical Specifications

### Context Types
1. **User Profile Context**
   - Basic info: Name, experience level, location, plant preferences
   - Care patterns: Watering frequency, light preferences, plant placement
   - Success/failure patterns: Plants that thrived/died, lessons learned

2. **Plant Collection Context**
   - Active plants: Species, location, care history, current status
   - Historical plants: Past ownership, outcomes, learned lessons
   - Plant relationships: Groupings, care schedules, environmental needs

3. **Conversation Context**
   - Topic summaries: Key discussions, advice given, problems solved
   - Recurring themes: Common questions, ongoing issues, interests
   - Interaction patterns: Preferred communication style, response types

### Pinecone Schema
```json
{
  "id": "user_{user_id}_context_{context_type}_{timestamp}",
  "values": [1536-dimensional vector],
  "metadata": {
    "user_id": "uuid",
    "context_type": "profile|plant|conversation",
    "timestamp": "iso8601",
    "plant_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2"],
